    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Note</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>UI</td><td>You can use Ans with "." only if Ans is an integer <strong>→</strong> if Ans is 3 and Ans.4 is evaluated, then 3.4 will be outputted; if Ans is a decimal a period will not be able to be placed</td></tr>
        <tr><td>UI</td><td>All buttons with a black border around them are able to be held for 1 second to display a popup <strong>→</strong> with the S<sub>x</sub> and log<sub>10</sub>(x) buttons, pressing the 'a' key within the inputs will set it to 'Ans()' where the value inside the brackets accesses the entry history to return the according value</td></tr>
        <tr><td>UI</td><td>Hovering over an entry inputted value in the top left will display the replacement value used <strong>→</strong> hovering over the Ans(2) in LOG<sub>Ans(2)</sub> (after inputting that to the log base popup) will reveal the second answer entry</td></tr>
        <tr><td>UI</td><td>For creating variables, any character except for space is permitted, and typing a non-existent variable after 'V' in the bar will result in a VariableError <strong>→</strong> if there is a variable 'a' with value 5, then typing anything other than 'a' after 'V' will throw the error</td></tr>
        <tr><td>UI</td><td>The font size of the bar decreases by 5px every 5 characters after 15 characters a max of 3 times (after 25 characters).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>Multifactorialing is not allowed <strong>→</strong> 6!! will not evaluate to neither 6×4×2 nor (6!)! but will instead error</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>The calculator may repeat 9's or 0's when it shouldn't <strong>→</strong> due to floating point precision issues which are inherent in code, outputs such as 0.30000000000000004 or 0.29999999999999999 may occur, although their effect on the desired value is negligible</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>There are five possible errors to receive <strong>→</strong> CalculationError (most common) when trying to evaluate an invalid expression, ZeroDivisionError when trying to divide by 0, EntryError when either trying to evaluate when out of space, or using an invalid Ans() value in either a variable, function, or expression, VariableError, when a non-existent variable is attempted to be used, and PasteError when pasting an invalid expression</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>Implicit multiplication is valid <strong>→</strong> having '3π' or '3sin(90)' or '3!3' will be interpreted as '3*π', '3*sin(90)', and '3!*3' respectively</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>An evaluation will automatically convert to scientific notation if the result is either, between -9E-6 and 1E-6, greater than 1E15, or less than -1E15<strong>→</strong> if the evaluation is greater than ~1.8E308 then a CalculationError will be thrown, or if it is between ±5E-324, then 0 will be returned</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>Ans(n) will evaluate to the nth answer entry <strong>→</strong> having this live in the bar will display the current used answer entry in the evaluation as "Ans #n/N ==&gt; x" where N is the total number of entries, and x is the value at that entry.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>For functions (such as sin, log, exp, etc.) evaluating when nothing is in the parentheses is equivalent to evaluating at 0 <strong>→</strong> sin() evaluates to 0, log() errors, exp() evaluates to 1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Entries</td><td>Any entry can be accessed from the bar with the expression 'Ans(n)' where n can only be a positive integer.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Entries</td><td>The approximate number of vacant entries is calculated based on the average byte size of each entry (each character is 1 byte) <strong>→</strong> there is a total of 300KB of allocated space for the entries</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Entries</td><td>The 'filter' section on the right of the answer entries page is used for finding and managing history entries<strong>→</strong> the inputs are used to narrow down the filter (used for finding information) while the buttons are mostly for selection and deletion</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Entries</td><td>The 'Select Mode' checkbox allows the entry to be selected on click while the 'regex' inputs are for regular expressions <strong>→</strong> regex is a mini-programming language used to match text based on a pattern, <a href="https://regexone.com/">https://regexone.com/</a> is an example of a tutorial that may be useful</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Miscellaneous</td><td>There may be cases of incorrect calculation and situations that were not tested <strong>→</strong> it is important to report any bugs or issues with the calculator so they can be fixed</td></tr>
